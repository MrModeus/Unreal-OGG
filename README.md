# Unreal-OGG (forked to attempt 4.20 compatible version)
## Compiles. Needs testing.
The code is compiling in VS 2017 for UE 4.20.2, but there is a crash bug when playing an ogg file.
## Features
- Allows importing and playing OGG files In UE4
- Master Branch allows you to Import OGG files and played using a LoadOGG Asset function (fast call)
- USoundWave Branch allows same functionality (more or less) as importing a wav file
